# Task Management API 

## 1. Introduction
This project is a RESTful API for task management built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## 2. Problem Statement
The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## 3. Design Choices
- **MongoDB** is used for persistent storage.
- **Express.js** handles routing and HTTP requests.

## 4. Algorithm and Logic
The `POST /tasks` endpoint allows task creation, while `GET /tasks/:id` fetches a task by its ID.

## 5. Testing and Validation
The API was tested using Postman to verify each endpoint.
